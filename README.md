<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

A web application that gives you real-time data for bike points in a selected area of London. It displays the bike points for a certain area on a map and displays the information on multiple charts that react to user changes.

I believe that most people who would be looking for bikepoints in London would do so on their mobile phones, so I made sure to make the site mobile responsive.
